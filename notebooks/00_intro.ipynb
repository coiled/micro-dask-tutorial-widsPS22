    "Timseries dataset for one week, with one row per second (publicly accessible, see [this github repo](https://github.com/coiled/coiled-datasets) for more background). Using pandas, it's very easy to take one week of this dataset and calculate the counts of unique values for a given column:\n",

The tricky part is figuring out how to break the computation into chunks, which in this example was fairly straightforward, but other computations can become more complicted, which is where Dask comes in!"

    "# What is Dask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is an open-source parallel & distributed computing framework for Python, which supports __larger-than-memory computation__, enabling data processing and modeling for datasets that don’t fit in RAM. Dask is used in a wide range of domains from finance and retail to academia and life sciences (check out [this video](https://youtu.be/t_GRK4L-bnw) or [blog post](https://coiled.io/blog/who-uses-dask/) on who uses Dask). It is also leveraged internally by numerous special-purpose tools like XGBoost, RAPIDS, PyTorch, Prefect, and Airflow. It’s developed in ongoing collaboration with the PyData community making it easy to learn, integrate, and operate. The familiarity of collections like Dask DataFrame to pandas allow you to quickly get started on your hardware of choice– be it your laptop, cloud service, or HPC cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How can I use Dask?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with Numpy, pandas and scikit-learn then think of Dask as their faster cousin. Take this example comparing the syntax for a simple groupby using pandas versus Dask DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# pandas syntax                       # dask dataframe syntax\n",
    "import pandas as pd                   import dask.dataframe as dd\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('2015-01-01.csv')    df = dd.read_csv('2015-*-*.csv')\n",
    "df.groupby('user_id').value.mean()    df.groupby('user_id').value.mean().compute()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# How does Dask work?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of Dask at a high- and low- level. The high-level colletions Array, Bag, and DataFrame mimic NumPy, lists, and pandas but can operate in parallel on datasets that don’t fit into memory. Delayed and Futures are low-level collections for custom computations. In addition to these high-level collections, Dask provides dynamic task schedulers that execute the task graphs created from high-level collections and custom workloads.\n",

You'll see the biggest performance improvements for problems that are memory-bound or compute-bound (or both). If you don't have any of these problems, you're likely better off using pandas or scikit-learn directly. If you're still not sure, check out [Why Dask?](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/why.html)\n",
